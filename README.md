# Replication: Michael P. Keane & Kenneth I. Wopin
This notebook replicates results from:

Keane, M. P. & Wopin, W. I. (1997). [The career Decisions of Young Men.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/262080), 
*Journal of Political Economy, 105(3): 473-552.*105(3): 473-552.

For this purpose l rely on the  *respy* and *estimagic* open-source python packages. [*Respy*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/respy) is for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model and [*Estimagic*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic) helps to build high-quality and user friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models.

## Motivation for replicating KW1997

Often times, the research outcomes that emerge from data in the developed world's context do not easily replicate in a developing country setting. However, many lessons could be drawn from them to learn something about human capital formation. I chose to replicate this paper to learn more about structural econometrics methods in a human capital formation setting. I hope to apply my knowledge to address questions, in the future, such as how to increase the level of skill acquired in the higher education system such that the up and coming generation of the African workforce is well equiped for competent roles in the labour market. Ultimately, this could inform policy to help achieve the African Union's 2063 vision - to build an intergrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens.

## Project structure

In **section 1**, l give an introduction to the project, my motivation for replicating KW1997 as well what motivates the paper. I replicate the descriptive statistics of the data and illustrate them graphically in **section 2**. It should be kept in mind whilst interpreting the graphs, that as the number of periods increase, sample attrition plays a role. In **section 3**, l discuss the theoratical framework of the paper, which ties back to the discriptive statistics in section 2, as well as develop a causal graphical framework for the model.  I then reproduce the main reslults in **section 4** using the *respy* and *estimagic* packages and calculate standard errors for the estimated parameters. In **section 5**, l discuss the results of the paper and my thoughts on some avenues for possible extension which inturn concludes my contribution to the replication of KW1997.
