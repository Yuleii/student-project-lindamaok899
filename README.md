# Project Title

This notebook replicates results from:

Keane, M. P. & Wopin, W. I. (1997). [The career Decisions of Young Men.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/262080), 
*Journal of Political Economy, 105(3): 473-552.*105(3): 473-552.

For this purpose l rely on the  *respy* and *estimagic* open-source python packages. [*Respy*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/respy) is for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model and [*Estimagic*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic) helps to build high-quality and user friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models.

## Project structure

In **section 1**, l talk about the groundwork that l have done in preperation for replicating KW1997. I talk also about the authors' motivation and show the theoratical framework behind the paper. In keeping with the fundamentals of the course, l develop a causal framework for the discrete choice dynamic programming model. I load the data and create several plots that help us to understand what the data represents with respect to the variables within the dataset in **section 2**. It should be kept in mind whilst interpreting the graphs, that as the number of periods increase, sample attrition that plays a role. I then reproduce the main reslults in **section 3** using the *respy* and *estimagic* packages and calculate standard errors for the estimated parameters. In **section 4**, l discuss the results of the paper and my thoughts on some avenues for possible extension which inturn concludes my contribution to the replication of KW1997.
