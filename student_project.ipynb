    "For the *respy* package, l have integrated the results of a project l previously completed on [benchmarking various implementations of ols and iv ](https://github.com/lindamaok899/least_squares). This was done to drop all statsmodels dependencies in the package in favor of incorporating a faster method of calculating ols estimates. I have also integrated a root mean squared error (rmse) function in the package for the same purpose of dropping the dependency on statsmodels.\n",

    "For the *estimagic* package, l have worked on the documentation of the numerical optimisers used in the package. In particular, l have created reference dictionaries for the different arguments that relate to the various implemented numerical optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both packages and an additional project (*uncertainty quantification project*), l have also calculated standard errors for parameter estimates of likelihood models. More specifically, l write functions that construct the full covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. There are different ways to calculate those covariance matrices, but in all cases they are based on some kind of derivative of the log likelihood function (loglike) or the log likelihood function per observation (loglikeobs). I have implemented the different ways to calculate these covariance matrices in the [standard_errors](https://github.com/lindamaok899/standard_errors) repository and will also encorporate the neccesary functions for the replication in the auxilliary folder.\n"
