    "For the *respy* package, l have integrated the results of a project l previously completed on [benchmarking various implementations of ols and iv ](https://github.com/lindamaok899/least_squares). This was done to drop all statsmodels dependencies in the package in favor of incorporating a faster method of calculating ols estimates. I have also integrated a root mean squared error (rmse) function in the package for the same purpose.\n",

    "For the *estimagic* package, l have worked on the documentation of the numerical optimisers used in the package. In particular, l have created reference dictionaries for the different arguments that relate to the various implemented numerical optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both packages and an additional project (*uncertainty quantification project*), l have also calculated standard errors for parameter estimates of likelihood models. More specifically, l write functions that construct the full covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. There are different ways to calculate those covariance matrices, but in all cases they are based on a derivative of the log likelihood function. I have implemented the different ways to calculate these covariance matrices in the [standard_errors](https://github.com/lindamaok899/standard_errors) repository and will also encorporate the neccesary functions for the replication in the auxilliary folder.\n"
