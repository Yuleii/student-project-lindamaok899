    "This project builds upon collaboration and contributions to the *respy* and *estimagic* open source pacakges. In particular, l have worked with some of the open source contributors of these packages to develop parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *respy* package, l have integrated the results of a project l previously completed on [benchmarking various implementations of ols and iv ](https://github.com/lindamaok899/least_squares). This was done to drop all statsmodels dependencies in the package in favor of incorporating a faster method of calculating ols estimates. I have also integrated a root mean squared error (rmse) function in the package for the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *estimagic* package, l have worked on the documentation of the numerical optimisers used in the package. In particular, l have created reference dictionaries for the different arguments that relate to the various implemented numerical optimizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both packages and an additional project (*uncertainty quantification project*), l have also calculated standard errors for parameter estimates of likelihood models. More specifically, l write functions that construct the full covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. There are different ways to calculate those covariance matrices, but in all cases they are based on derivatives of the log likelihood function. I have also written a function that extracts the diagonal elements of these covariance matrices to contstuct a 1d array of containing the standard errors. After this, l have written a benchmarking module that compares the functions to the statsmodels output to ensure complete accuracy of the covariance matrices. Lastly, l have written tests to all the encorprated functions. The under-the-hood workings of this part of my assignment can be viewed in an independent repository: [standard_errors](https://github.com/lindamaok899/standard_errors). Subsequently, l will encorporate the neccesary functions for the replication in the auxilliary folder.\n"

    "#### Authors' motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper provides structural estimates of schooling, work and occupational choice decisions based on 11 years of observations on a sample of 1400 white young men from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY). The authors ingeminate the importance of encorporating self selection for an accurate assessment of the differential productivity of human capital investment. In their paper, they extend earlier (prior to 1997) work done in the this field by considering self-selection in the three dimensions of schooling, work and occupational choice. More specifically, they extend the static deterministic setting of earlier models (Heckman and Sedlacek, 1985; Willis, 1986), each of which is an extension of the basic Roy (1951) framework, to a model in which decision making is sequential and the environment is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structural approach in Keane and Wopin (1997) provides rigorous interpretations for the parameters that are estimated, which has several important implications for ex-ante policy evaluation such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) predicting the effect an intervention that provides college tuition subsidies has on college attendance rates and subsequent occupational choice decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "2) assessing the welfare effects of interventions on lifetime wealth and utility, allowing policy makers to draw distributional consequences of them \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the model, the participants are assigned in each year to one of five discrete, mutually exclusive alternatives: attending school, working in a white collar occupation, working in a blue collar occupation, working in the military or engaging on home production."
